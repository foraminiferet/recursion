# Ruby Recursion
This snippet of code is used to practice recursion by implementing it with the Fibonacci sequence and Merge sort
## Fibonacci Array
The first '''fibs(n)''' function we created uses iteration to create the sequence. While the second implemented
function '''fibs_rec(n)''' uses recursion to get the same job done, it is used for practice and understanding
